{"domain": "gst", "file": "gst faq.pdf", "page": 5, "text": "1. Overview of Goods and Services Tax\n(GST)\nQ 1. What is Goods and Services Tax\n(GST)?\nAns. It is a destination based tax on consumption of goods\nand services. It is proposed to be levied at all stages right\nfrom manufacture up to final consumption with credit of\ntaxes paid at previous stages available as setoff. In a\nnutshell, only value addition will be taxed and burden of\ntax is to be borne by the final consumer.\nQ 2. What exactly is the concept of destination based\ntax on consumption?\nAns. The tax would accrue to the taxing authority which\nhas jurisdiction over the place of consumption which is\nalso termed as place of supply.\nQ 3. Which of the existing taxes are proposed to be\nsubsumed under GST?\nAns. The GST would replace the following taxes:\n(i) taxes currently levied and collected by the Centre:\na. Central Excise duty\nb. Duties of Excise (Medicinal and Toilet\nPreparations)\nc. Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special\nImportance)\nd. Additional Duties of Excise (Textiles and Textile\nProducts)\ne. Additional Duties of Customs (commonly known\nas CVD)"}

What principles were adopted for subsuming\nthe above taxes under GST?\nAns. The various Central, State and Local levies were\nexamined to identify their possibility of being subsumed\nunder GST. While identifying, the following principles were\nkept in mind:\n(i) Taxes or levies to be subsumed should be primarily in\nthe nature of indirect taxes, either on the supply of goods\nor on the supply of services."}
{"domain": "gst", "file": "gst faq.pdf", "page": 7, "text": "(ii) Taxes or levies to be subsumed should be part of\nthe transaction chain which commences with import/\nmanufacture/ production of goods or provision of services\nat one end and the consumption of goods and services at\nthe other.\n(iii) The subsumation should result in free flow of tax\ncredit in intra and inter-State levels. The taxes, levies and\nfees that are not specifically related to supply of goods &\nservices should not be subsumed under GST.\n(v) Revenue fairness for both the Union and the States\nindividually would need to be attempted.\nQ 5. Which are the commodities proposed to be kept\noutside the purview of GST?\nAns. Article 366(12A) of the Constitution as amended by\n101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016 defines the Goods\nand Services tax (GST) as a tax on supply of goods or\nservices or both, except supply of alcoholic liquor for human\nconsumption. So alcohol for human consumption is kept out\nof GST by way of definition of GST in constitution. Five\npetroleum products viz. petroleum crude, motor spirit\n(petrol), high speed diesel, natural gas and aviation\nturbine fuel have temporarily been kept out and GST\nCouncil shall decide the date from which they shall be\nincluded in GST. Furthermore, electricity has been kept out\nof GST.\nQ 6. What will be the status in respect of taxation of\nabove commodities after introduction of GST?\nAns. The existing taxation system (VAT & Central Excise)\nwill continue in respect of the above commodities.\nQ 7. What will be status of Tobacco and Tobacco"}
{"domain": "gst", "file": "gst faq.pdf", "page": 8, "text": "products under the GST regime?\nAns. Tobacco and tobacco products would be subject to\nGST. In addition, the Centre would have the power to levy\nCentral Excise duty on these products.\nQ 8. What type of GST is proposed to be\nimplemented?\nAns. It would be a dual GST with the Centre and States\nsimultaneously levying it on a common tax base. The GST\nto be levied by the Centre on intra-State supply of goods\nand / or services would be called the Central GST (CGST)\nand that to be levied by the States/ Union territory would\nbe called the State GST (SGST)/ UTGST. Similarly,\nIntegrated GST (IGST) will be levied and administered by\nCentre on every inter-state supply of goods and services.\nQ 9. Why is Dual GST required?\nAns. India is a federal country where both the Centre and\nthe States have been assigned the powers to levy and collect\ntaxes through appropriate legislation. Both the\nlevels of Government have distinct responsibilities to\nperform according to the division of powers prescribed in\nthe Constitution for which they need to raise resources. A\ndual GST will, therefore, be in keeping with the\nConstitutional requirement of fiscal federalism.\nQ 10. Which authority will levy and administer\nGST?\nAns. Centre will levy and administer CGST & IGST while\nrespective states /UTs will levy and administer SGST/\nUTGST.\nQ 11. Why was the Constitution of India amended\nrecently in the context of GST?"}
{"domain": "gst", "file": "gst faq.pdf", "page": 9, "text": "Currently, the fiscal powers between the Centre and the\nStates are clearly demarcated in the Constitution with\nalmost no overlap between the respective domains. The\nCentre has the powers to levy tax on the manufacture of\ngoods (except alcoholic liquor for human consumption,\nopium, narcotics etc.) while the States have the powers\nto levy tax on the sale of goods. In the case of inter-State\nsales, the Centre has the power to levy a tax (the Central\nSales Tax) but, the tax is collected and retained entirely\nby the States. As for services, it is the Centre alone that\nis empowered to levy service tax.\nIntroduction of the GST required amendments in the\nConstitution so as to simultaneously empower the Centre\nand the States to levy and collect this tax. The Constitution\nof India has been amended by the Constitution (one hundred\nand first amendment) Act, 2016 for this purpose. Article\n246A of the Constitution empowers the Centre and the\nStates to levy and collect the GST.\nQ 12. How a particular transaction of goods\nand services would be taxed simultaneously\nunder Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST)?\nAns. The Central GST and the State GST would be levied\nsimultaneously on every transaction of supply of goods and\nservices except the exempted goods and services, goods\nwhich are outside the purview of GST and the transactions\nwhich are below the prescribed threshold limits. Further,\nboth would be levied on the same price or value unlike\nState VAT which is levied on the value of the goods inclusive\nof CENVAT. While the location of the supplier and the\nrecipient within the country is immaterial for the purpose\nof CGST, SGST would be chargeable only when the supplier\nand the recipient are both located within the State."}
{"domain": "gst", "file": "gst faq.pdf", "page": 10, "text": "Illustration I: Suppose hypothetically that the rate of CGST\nis 10% and that of SGST is 10%. When a wholesale dealer\nof steel in Uttar Pradesh supplies steel bars and rods to\na construction company which is also located within the\nsame State for, say Rs. 100, the dealer would charge CGST\nof Rs. 10 and SGST of Rs. 10 in addition to the basic price\nof the goods. He would be required to deposit the CGST\ncomponent into a Central Government account\nwhile the SGST portion into the account of the concerned\nState Government. Of course, he need not actually pay Rs.\n20 (Rs. 10 + Rs. 10) in cash as he would be entitled to set-\noff this liability against the CGST or SGST paid on his\npurchases (say, inputs). But for paying CGST he would be\nallowed to use only the credit of CGST paid on his\npurchases while for SGST he can utilize the credit of SGST\nalone. In other words, CGST credit cannot, in general, be\nused for payment of SGST. Nor can SGST credit be used for\npayment of CGST.\nIllustration II: Suppose, again hypothetically, that the\nrate of CGST is 10% and that of SGST is 10%. When an\nadvertising company located in Mumbai supplies\nadvertising services to a company manufacturing soap\nalso located within the State of Maharashtra for, let us\nsay Rs. 100, the ad company would charge CGST of\nRs. 10 as well as SGST of Rs. 10 to the basic value of\nthe service.

In other words, CGST credit cannot,\nin general, be used for payment of SGST. Nor can SGST\ncredit be used for payment of CGST.\nQ 13. What are the benefits which the Country will\naccrue from GST?\nAns. Introduction of GST would be a very significant step in\nthe field of indirect tax reforms in India. By amalgamating\na large number of Central and State taxes into a single tax\nand allowing set-off of prior-stage taxes, it would mitigate\nthe ill effects of cascading and pave the way for a common\nnational market. For the consumers, the biggest gain would\nbe in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods,\nwhich is currently estimated at 25%-30%. Introduction\nof GST would also make our products competitive in the\ndomestic and international markets. Studies show that this\nwould instantly spur economic growth. There may also be\nrevenue gain for the Centre and the States due to widening\nof the tax base, increase in trade volumes and improved\ntax compliance. Last but not the least, this tax, because of\nits transparent character, would be easier to administer.\nQ 14. What is IGST?\nAns. Under the GST regime, an Integrated GST (IGST)\nwould be levied and collected by the Centre on inter-State\nsupply of goods and services. Under Article 269A of the\nConstitution, the GST on supplies in the course of inter-\nState trade or commerce shall be levied and collected by\nthe Government of India and such tax shall be apportioned\nbetween the Union and the States in the manner as may be\nprovided by Parliament by law on the recommendations of\nthe Goods and Services Tax Council.\nQ 15. Who will decide rates for levy of GST?"}
{"domain": "gst", "file": "gst faq.pdf", "page": 12, "text": "Ans. The CGST and SGST would be levied at rates to be\njointly decided by the Centre and States. The rates would\nbe notified on the recommendations of the GST Council.\nQ 15. What would be the role of GST Council?\nAns. A GST Council would be constituted comprising the\nUnion Finance Minister (who will be the Chairman of the\nCouncil), the Minister of State (Revenue) and the State\nFinance/Taxation Ministers to make recommendations to the\nUnion and the States on\n(i) the taxes, cesses and surcharges levied by the\nCentre, the States and the local bodies which\nmay be subsumed under GST;\n(ii) the goods and services that may be subjected to\nor exempted from the GST;\n(iii) the date on which the GST shall be levied on\npetroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor sprit\n(commonly known as petrol), natural gas and\naviation turbine fuel;\n(iv) model GST laws, principles of levy, apportionment\nof IGST and the principles that govern the place\nof supply;\n(v) the threshold limit of turnover below which the\ngoods and services may be exempted from GST;\n(vi) the rates including floor rates with bands of\nGST;\n(vii) any special rate or rates for a specified period\nto raise additional resources during any natural\ncalamity or disaster;\n(viii) special provision with respect to the North-\nEast States, J&K, Himachal Pradesh and\nUttarakhand; and"}

The mechanism of GST Council would ensure\nharmonization on different aspects of GST between the\nCentre and the States as well as among States. It has been\nprovided in the Constitution (one hundred\nand first amendment) Act, 2016 that the GST Council, in\nits discharge of various functions, shall be guided by the\nneed for a harmonized structure of GST and for the\ndevelopment of a harmonized national market for goods\nand services.\nQ 17. How will decisions be taken by GST Council?\nAns. The Constitution (one hundred and first amendment)\nAct, 2016 provides that every decision of the GST Council\nshall be taken at a meeting by a majority of not less than\n3/4th of the weighted votes of the Members present and\nvoting. The vote of the Central Government shall have a\nweightage of 1/3rd of the votes cast and the votes of all the\nState Governments taken together shall have a weightage\nof 2/3rd of the total votes cast in that meeting. One half\nof the total number of members of the GST Council shall\nconstitute the quorum at its meetings.\nQ 18. Who is liable to pay GST under the proposed\nGST regime?\nAns. Under the GST regime, tax is payable by the taxable\nperson on the supply of goods and/or services. Liability to\npay tax arises when the taxable person crosses the turnover\nthreshold of Rs.20 lakhs (Rs. 10 lakhs for NE & Special\nCategory States) except in certain specified cases where the\ntaxable person is liable to pay GST even though he has not"}

What are the benefits available to small tax\npayers under the GST regime?\nAns. Tax payers with an aggregate turnover in a financial\nyear up to [Rs.20 lakhs & Rs.10 Lakhs for NE and special\ncategory states] would be exempt from tax. Further,\na person whose aggregate turnover in the preceding\nfinancial year is less than Rs.50 Lakhs can opt for a\nsimplified composition scheme where tax will payable at a\nconcessional rate on the turnover in a state.\n[Aggregate turnover shall include the aggregate value of\nall taxable supplies, exempt supplies and exports of goods\nand/or services and exclude taxes viz.

How will imports be taxed under GST?\nAns. Imports of Goods and Services will be treated as\ninter-state supplies and IGST will be levied on import of\ngoods and services into the country. The incidence of tax\nwill follow the destination principle and the tax revenue in\ncase of SGST will accrue to the State where the imported\ngoods and services are consumed.

Whether the composition scheme will be\noptional or compulsory?\nAns. Optional.\nQ 25. What is GSTN and its role in the GST regime?\nAns. GSTN stands for Goods and Service Tax Network\n(GSTN). A Special Purpose Vehicle called the GSTN has\nbeen set up to cater to the needs of GST. The GSTN shall\nprovide a shared IT infrastructure and services to Central\nand State Governments, tax payers and other stakeholders\nfor implementation of GST.

Whether actionable claims liable to GST?\nAns. As per section 2(52) of the CGST/SGST Act\nactionable claims are to be considered as goods. Schedule III\nread with Section 7 of the CGST/SGST Act lists the activities\nor transactions which shall be treated neither as supply of\ngoods nor supply of services. The Schedule lists actionable\nclaims other than lottery, betting and gambling as one of\nsuch transactions.

It is not possible many a times to establish a\none-to-one link between quantum of input\nservices used in the course or furtherance of\nbusiness by a supplier. In such situations, how\ndistribution of ITC by the ISD is to be done?\nAns. In such situations, distribution would be based on a\nformula. Firstly, distribution would be done only amongst\nthose recipients of input tax credit to whom the input\nservice being distributed are attributable. Secondly,\ndistribution would be done amongst the operational units\nonly.

Only\ncertain prescribed fields of information from invoices need\nto be uploaded.\nQ 5. Whether all invoices will have to be\nuploaded?\nAns. No. It depends on whether B2B or B2C plus whether\nIntra-state or Inter-state supplies.\nFor B2B supplies, all invoices, whether Intra-state or Inter-\nstate supplies, will have to be uploaded. Why So? Because\nITC will be taken by the recipients, invoice matching is\nrequired to be done.\nIn B2C supplies, uploading in general may not be required\nas the buyer will not be taking ITC. However still in order\nto implement the destination based principle, invoices of\nvalue more than Rs.2.5 lacs in inter-state B2C supplies will\nhave to be uploaded.

What if no consideration?\nAns. Yes. Not only value but taxable value will also have to\nbe fed. In some cases, both may be different.\nIn case there is no consideration, but it is supply by\nvirtue of schedule 1, the taxable value will have to be\nworked out as prescribed and uploaded.\nQ 8. Can a recipient feed information in his GSTR-2\nwhich has been missed by the supplier?\nAns. Yes, the recipient can himself feed the invoices not\nuploaded by his supplier.

Whether\nITC is to be given or denied? If denied, what\naction is taken against supplier?\nAns. If invoices in GSTR-2 do not match with invoices in\ncounter-party GSTR-1, then such mismatch shall be\nintimated to the supplier. Mismatch can be because of two\nreasons. First, it could be due to mistake at the side of the\nrecipient, and in such a case, no further action is required.\nSecondly, it could be possible that the said invoice was\nissued by supplier but he did not upload it and pay tax on\nit. In such a case, the ITC availed by the recipient would be\nadded to his output tax liability, in short, all mismatches will\nlead to proceedings if the supplier has made a supply but\nnot paid tax on it.\nQ 11. What will be the legal position in regard to the\nreversed input tax credit if the supplier later\nrealizes the mistake and feeds the information?\nAns.

They have to\nfile a quarterly return in Form GSTR-4 by the 18th of the\nmonth after the end of the quarter. Since they are not\neligible for any input tax credit, there is no relevance\nof GSTR-2 for them and since the credit of tax paid under\nComposition Levy is not eligible, there is no relevance of\nGSTR-1 for them.

{"domain": "gst", "file": "gst faq.pdf", "page": 105, "text": "if some changes are required to be made?\nAns. In GST since the returns are built from details of\nindividual transactions, there is no requirement for having\na revised return. Any need to revise a return may arise\ndue to the need to change a set of invoices or debit/ credit\nnotes. Instead of revising the return already submitted, the\nsystem will allow changing the details of those transactions\n(invoices or debit/credit notes) that are required to be\namended. They can be amended in any of the future GSTR-\n1/2 in the tables specifically provided for the purposes of\namending previously declared details.\nQ 19. How can taxpayers file their returns?\nAns. Taxpayers will have various modes to file the\nstatements and returns. Firstly, they can file their statement\nand returns directly on the Common Portal online.

For such taxpayers, an\noffline utility will be provided that can be used for\npreparing the statements offline after downloading the\nauto populated details and uploading them on the\nCommon Portal.

What precautions, a taxpayer is required to\ntake for a hassle free compliance under GST?\nAns. One of the most important things under GST will be\ntimely uploading of the details of outward supplies in Form\nGSTR-1 by 10th of next month.

Therefore, it would always be\nbeneficial for the taxpayers to regularly upload the invoices.\nLast minute rush will make uploading difficult and will\ncome with higher risk of possible failure and default. The\nsecond thing would be to ensure that taxpayers follow up\non uploading the invoices of their inward supplies by their\nsuppliers. This would be helpful in ensuring that the input tax\ncredit is available without any hassle and delay. Recipients\ncan also encourage their suppliers to upload their invoices on\na regular basis instead of doing it on or close to the due date.\nThe system would allow recipients to see if their suppliers have\nuploaded invoices pertaining to them. The GSTN system will\nalso provide the track record about the compliance level of a\ntax payer, especially about his track record in respect of timely\nuploading of his supply invoices giving details about the auto\nreversals that have happened for invoices issued by a supplier.\nThe Common Portal of GST would have pan India data at one\nplace which will enable valuable services to the taxpayers.\nEfforts are being made to make regular uploading of invoices\nas easy as possible and it is expected that an enabling eco-\nsystem will be developed to achieve this objective.

Every person registered under the Act shall himself\nassess the tax payable by him for a tax period and after\nsuch assessment he shall file the return required under\nsection 39.\nQ 2. When can a taxable person pay tax on\na provisional basis?\nAns. As a taxpayer has to pay tax on self-assessment basis,\na request for paying tax on provisional basis has to come\nfrom the taxpayer which will then have to be permitted\nby the proper officer. In other words, no tax officer can\nsuo-moto order payment of tax on provisional basis. This\nis governed by section 60 of CGST/SGST Act. Tax can be\npaid on a provisional basis only after the proper officer has\npermitted it through an order passed by him. For this\npurpose, the taxable person has to make a written request\nto the proper officer, giving reasons for payment of tax on\na provisional basis. Such a request can be made by the\ntaxable person only in such cases where he is unable to\ndetermine:\na) the value of goods or services to be supplied by\nhim, or\nb) determine the tax rate applicable to the goods\nor services to be supplied by him.\nIn such cases the taxable person has to execute a bond in\nthe prescribed form, and with such surety or security as\nthe proper officer may deem fit."}

Where the tax liability as per the final\nassessment is higher than in provisional\nassessment, will the taxable person be liable to\npay interest?\nAns. Yes. He will be liable to pay interest from the date\nthe tax was due to be paid originally till the date of actual\npayment.\nQ 5. What recourse may be taken by the officer\nin case proper explanation is not furnished for\nthe discrepancy detected in the return filed,\nwhile conducting scrutiny under section 61 of\nCGST ACT?\nAns.

The draft IGST law contains 25 sections divided into9\nChapters. The law, inter alia, sets out the rules for\ndetermination of the place of supply of goods. Where the\nsupply involves movement of goods, the place of supply shall\nbe the location of goods at the time at which the movement\nof goods terminates for delivery to the recipient. Where the\nsupply does not involve movement of goods, the place of\nsupply shall be the location of such goods at the time of\ndelivery to the recipient. In the case of goods assembled or\ninstalled at site, the place of supply shall be the place of such\ninstallation or assembly. Finally, where the goods are\nsupplied on board a conveyance, the place of supply shall be\nthe location at which such goods are taken on board.\nThe law also provides for determination of place of supply of\nservice where both supplier and recipient are located in\nIndia (domestic supplies) or where supplier or recipient is\nlocated outside India (international supplies).

{"domain": "gst", "file": "gst faq.pdf", "page": 187, "text": "22. Place of Supply of Goods and Service\nQ 1. What is the need for the Place of Supply of\nGoods and Services under GST?\nAns. The basic principle of GST is that it should effectively\ntax the consumption of such supplies at the destination\nthereof or as the case may at the point of consumption. So\nplace of supply provision determines the place i.e. taxable\njurisdiction where the tax should reach. The place of supply\ndetermines whether a transaction is intra-state or inter-\nstate. In other words, the place of Supply of Goods or\nservices is required to determine whether a supply is subject\nto SGST plus CGST in a given State or union territory or else\nwould attract IGST if it is an inter-state supply.\nQ 2. Why are place of supply provisions different in\nrespect of goods and services?\nAns. Goods being tangible do not pose any significant\nproblems for determination of their place of consumption.\nServices being intangible pose problems w.r.t determination\nof place of supply mainly due to following factors:\n(i) The manner of delivery of service could be altered\neasily. For example, telecom service could change from\nmostly post-paid to mostly pre-paid; billing address could be\nchanged, billers address could be changed, repair or\nmaintenance of software could be changed from onsite to\nonline; banking services were earlier required customer to\ngo to the bank, now the customer could avail service from\nanywhere;"}

The location of\nbilling could be changed overnight;\n(iv) Sometime the same element may flow to more than one\nlocation, for example, construction or other services in\nrespect of a railway line, a national highway or a bridge on\na river which originate in one state and end in the other\nstate. Similarly, a copy right for distribution and exhibition\nof film could be assigned for many states in single\ntransaction or an advertisement or a programme is\nbroadcasted across the country at the same time.

The card issued by Delhi metro could be used by a\nperson located in Noida, or Delhi or Faridabad, without the\nDelhi metro being able to distinguish the location or\njourneys at the time of receipt of payment;\n(v) Services are continuously evolving and would thus\ncontinue to pose newer challenges. For example, 15-20\nyears back no one could have thought of DTH, online\ninformation, online banking, online booking of tickets,\ninternet, mobile telecommunication etc.\nQ 3.

It is unique as it seeks, for the first time to\nestablish a uniform interface for the tax payer and a\ncommon and shared IT infrastructure between the Centre\nand States. Currently, the Centre and State indirect tax\nadministrations work under different laws, regulations,\nprocedures and formats and consequently the IT systems\nwork as independent sites. Integrating them for GST\nimplementation would be complex since it would involve\nintegrating the entire indirect tax ecosystem so as to bring\nall the tax administrations (Centre, State and Union\nTerritories) to the same level of IT maturity with uniform\nformats and interfaces for taxpayers and other external\nstakeholders. Besides, GST being a destination based tax,\nthe inter- state trade of goods and services (IGST) would\nneed a robust settlement mechanism amongst the States\nand the Centre. This is possible only when there is a strong"}
