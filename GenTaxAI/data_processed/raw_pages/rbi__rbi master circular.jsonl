The banking system in\nIndia today has perhaps the largest outreach for delivery of financial services and is\nalso serving as an important conduit for delivery of financial services. While the\ncoverage has been expanding day by day, the quality and content of dispensation of\ncustomer service has come under tremendous pressure mainly owing to the failure to\nhandle the soaring demands and expectations of the customers.\nThe vast network of branches spread over the entire country with millions of customers,\na complex variety of products and services offered, the varied institutional framework –\nall these add to the enormity and complexity of banking operations in India giving rise to\ncomplaints for deficiencies in services. This is evidenced by a series of studies\nconducted by various committees such as the Talwar Committee, Goiporia Committee,\nTarapore Committee, etc., to bring in improvement in performance and procedure\ninvolved in the dispensation of hassle-free customer service.\nReserve Bank, as the regulator of the banking sector, has been actively engaged from\nthe very beginning in the review, examination and evaluation of customer service in\nbanks. It has constantly brought into sharp focus the inadequacy in banking services\navailable to the common person and the need to benchmark the current level of service,\nreview the progress periodically, enhance the timeliness and quality, rationalize the\nprocesses taking into account technological developments, and suggest appropriate\nincentives to facilitate change on an ongoing basis through instructions/guidelines.\nDepositors' interest forms the focal point of the regulatory framework for banking in\nIndia. There is a widespread feeling that the customer does not get satisfactory service\neven after demanding it and there has been a total disenfranchisement of the depositor.\nThere is, therefore, a need to reverse this trend and start a process of empowering the\ndepositor.\n- 1 -\nDBOD-Master Circular on Customer Service 2014"}
{"domain": "rbi", "file": "rbi master circular.pdf", "page": 10, "text": "Broadly, a customer can be defined as a user or a potential user of bank services. So\ndefined, a ‘Customer’ may include:\n a person or entity that maintains an account and/or has a business relationship\nwith the bank;\n one on whose behalf the account is maintained (i.e. the beneficial owner);\n beneficiaries of transactions conducted by professional intermediaries, such as\nStock Brokers, Chartered Accountants, Solicitors, etc., as permitted under the\nlaw, and\n any person or entity connected with a financial transaction which can pose\nsignificant reputational or other risks to the bank, say, a wire transfer or issue\nof a high value demand draft as a single transaction.\n1.1 General\nPolicy for general management of the branches\nBanks' systems should be oriented towards providing better customer service and they\nshould periodically study their systems and their impact on customer service. Banks\nshould have a Board approved policy for general management of the branches which\nmay include the following aspects:-\n(a) providing infrastructure facilities by branches by bestowing particular attention to\nproviding adequate space, proper furniture, drinking water facilities, with specific\nemphasis on pensioners, senior citizens, disabled persons, etc.\n(b) providing entirely separate enquiry counters at their large / bigger branches in\naddition to a regular reception counter.\n(c) displaying indicator boards at all the counters in English, Hindi as well as in the\nconcerned regional language. Business posters at semi-urban and rural branches of\nbanks should also be in the concerned regional languages.\n(d) posting roving officials to ensure employees' response to customers and for\nhelping out customers in putting in their transactions.\n(e) providing customers with booklets consisting of all details of service and facilities\navailable at the bank in Hindi, English and the concerned regional languages.\n- 2 -\nDBOD-Master Circular on Customer Service 2014"}

Customer Service: Institutional Framework\nNeed for Board's involvement\nMatters relating to customer service should be deliberated by the Board to ensure that\nthe instructions are implemented meaningfully. Commitment to hassle-free service to\nthe customer at large and the Common Person in particular under the oversight of the\nBoard should be the major responsibility of the Board.\n- 3 -\nDBOD-Master Circular on Customer Service 2014"}

After detailed examination of\nthe complaints / grievances of customers of banks and after perusal of the comments of\nbanks, the Banking Ombudsmen issue their awards in respect of individual complaints\n- 4 -\nDBOD-Master Circular on Customer Service 2014"}

The CPPAPS therefore recommended that the Ad hoc Committees should\nbe converted into Standing Committees on Customer Service.\nOn the basis of the above recommendation, banks are required to convert the existing\nAd hoc Committees into a Standing Committee on Customer Service.

The policy would also be\nrequired to cover all aspects of operations of deposit accounts, charges leviable and\nother related issues to facilitate interaction of depositors at branch levels. Such a policy\nshould also be explicit in regard to secrecy and confidentiality of the customers.\nProviding other facilities by \"tying-up\" with placement of deposits is clearly a restrictive\npractice.\n3.2 Cheque Collection Policy\nBanks should formulate a comprehensive and transparent policy taking into account\ntheir technological capabilities, systems and processes adopted for clearing\n- 7 -\nDBOD-Master Circular on Customer Service 2014"}

Use of\nstatements has some inherent difficulties viz., (a) these need to be filed regularly (b) the\nopening balance needs to be tallied with closing balance of last statement (c) loss of\nstatements in postal transit is not uncommon and obtaining duplicates thereof involves\nexpense and inconvenience (d) ATM slips during the interregnum between two\nstatements does not provide a satisfactory solution as full record of transactions is not\navailable and (e) there are a large number of small customers who do not have access\nto computers / internet, etc. As such, non-issuance of pass-books to such small\ncustomers would indirectly lead to their financial exclusion.\nBanks are therefore advised to invariably offer pass book facility to all its savings bank\naccount holders (individuals) and in case the bank offers the facility of sending\nstatement of account and the customer chooses to get statement of account, the banks\nmust issue monthly statement of accounts. The cost of providing such Pass Book or\nStatements should not be charged to the customer.\n(ii) It has come to our notice that some banks are not issuing pass books to their\nsavings banks account holders (individuals) and only issue a computer generated\naccount statement even when the customer desires pass book facility.

In addition to the instructions printed in the passbook, whenever a\npassbook is tendered for posting after a long interval of time or after very large number\nof transactions, a printed slip requesting the depositor to tender it periodically should be\ngiven.\n5.6.3 Entries in passbooks / statement of accounts\n(i) Banks should give constant attention to ensure entry of correct and legible\nparticulars in the pass books and statement of accounts.\n(ii) The banks often show the entries in depositors' passbooks / statements of\naccounts, as \"by clearing\" or \"by cheque\". Further, it is observed that in the case of\nElectronic Clearing System (ECS) and RBI Electronic Fund Transfer (RBIEFT), banks\ngenerally do not provide any details even though brief particulars of the remittance are\nprovided by the receiving bank.

Banks should refrain from obtaining such undertakings from depositors and\nensure that cheque books are delivered over the counters on request to the depositors\nor his authorized representative.\n5.7.4 Acceptance of cheques bearing a date as per\nNational Calendar (Saka Samvat) for payment\nGovernment of India has accepted Saka Samvat as National Calendar with effect from\n22 March 1957 and all Government statutory orders, notifications, Acts of Parliament,\netc. bear both the dates i.e., Saka Samvat as well as Gregorian Calendar.

Such insistence on\nthe signatures of both the depositors has the effect of making the mandate given by the\ndepositors redundant. This, in turn, results in unjustified delays and allegations of poor\ncustomer service.\n1. It is clarified that if fixed/term deposit accounts are opened with operating\ninstructions ‘Either or Survivor’, the signatures of both the depositors need not be\nobtained for payment of the amount of the deposits on maturity. However, the\nsignatures of both the depositors may have to be obtained, in case the deposit is to\nbe paid before maturity. If the operating instruction is ‘Either or Survivor’ and one of\nthe depositors expires before the maturity, no pre-payment of the fixed/term deposit\nmay be allowed without the concurrence of the legal heirs of the deceased joint\nholder. This, however, would not stand in the way of making payment to the survivor\non maturity.\n2. In case the mandate is ‘Former or Survivor’, the ‘Former’ alone can\noperate/withdraw the matured amount of the fixed/term deposit, when both the\ndepositors are alive. However, the signature of both the depositors may have to be\nobtained, in case the deposit is to be paid before maturity. If the former expires\nbefore the maturity of the fixed/term deposit, the ‘Survivor’ can withdraw the deposit\non maturity.

Banks are,\ntherefore, advised to invariably incorporate the aforesaid clause in the account\nopening form and also inform their existing as well as future term deposit holders\nabout the availability of such an option.\n5.

However, suitable note may be made\nregarding renewal in the deposit ledger.\n(iii) Renewal of deposit may be advised by registered letter / speed post / courier\nservice to the concerned Government department under advice to the depositor.

As such, banks cannot design any product which is\nnot in tune with the basic tenets of banking. Further, incorporating such clauses in the\nterms and conditions which restrict deposit of cash over the counters also amounts to\nan unfair practice.\nBanks are, therefore, advised to ensure that their branches invariably accept cash over\nthe counters from all their customers who desire to deposit cash at the counters.\nFurther, they are also advised to refrain from incorporating clauses in the terms and\nconditions which restrict deposit of cash over the counters.\n5.10 Opening accounts in the name of minors with Mothers as guardians\nConsiderable difficulty was experienced by women customers in opening bank accounts\nin the names of minors, with mothers as their guardians. Presumably, the banks were\nreluctant to accept the mother as a guardian of a minor, while father is alive in view of\nsection 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, which stipulates that the\nfather alone should be deemed to be the guardian in such case. To overcome this legal\ndifficulty and to enable the banks to open freely such accounts in the name of minors\nunder the guardianship of their mothers, it was suggested in some quarters that the\nabove provisions should be suitably amended. While it is true that an amendment of the\nabove Act may overcome the difficulty in the case of Hindus, it would not solve the\nproblem for other communities as minors belonging to Muslim, Christian, Parsi\ncommunities would still be left out unless the laws governing these communities are\nalso likewise amended.\n- 2 4 -\nDBOD-Master Circular on Customer Service 2014"}

In this way, the\nminors' capacity to enter into contract would not be a subject matter of dispute. If this\nprecaution is taken, the banks' interests would be adequately protected.\nBanks are advised to instruct their branches to allow minors' accounts (fixed and\nsavings only) with mothers as guardians to be opened, whenever such requests are\nreceived by them, subject to the safeguards mentioned above.\nThe facility of allowing opening of minor’s accounts with mothers as guardians may be\nextended to Recurring Deposit Accounts also subject to precautions mentioned above.\n5.10.1 Opening of Bank Accounts in the Names of Minors\nWith a view to promote the objective of financial inclusion and also to bring uniformity\namong banks in opening and operating minors’ accounts, banks are advised as under:\na. A savings /fixed / recurring bank deposit account can be opened by a minor of\nany age through his/her natural or legally appointed guardian.\nb. Minors above the age of 10 years may be allowed to open and operate savings\nbank accounts independently, if they so desire. Banks may, however, keeping in\nview their risk management systems, fix limits in terms of age and amount up to\nwhich minors may be allowed to operate the deposit accounts independently.\nThey can also decide, in their own discretion, as to what minimum documents\nare required for opening of accounts by minors.\nc. On attaining majority, the erstwhile minor should confirm the balance in his/her\naccount and if the account is operated by the natural guardian / legal guardian,\nfresh operating instructions and specimen signature of erstwhile minor should be\nobtained and kept on record for all operational purposes.\n- 2 5 -\nDBOD-Master Circular on Customer Service 2014"}

Banks should note that non-adherence to the above discipline could be\nperceived to be abetting the siphoning of funds and such violations which are either\nreported to RBI or noticed during our inspection would make the concerned banks liable\nfor penalty under Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\n(ii) Banks may open current accounts of prospective customers in case no response is\nreceived from the existing bankers after a minimum waiting period of a fortnight.

Recently, incidents of\nunauthorized / fraudulent withdrawals at ATMs have come to the notice of RBI. It is,\ntherefore, decided that banks may take steps to put in place a system of online alerts for\nall types of transactions irrespective of the amount, involving usage of cards at various\nchannels. This measure is expected to encourage further usage of cards at various\ndelivery channels. Banks have been advised to implement this measure latest by June\n30, 2011. Banks should provide easier methods (like SMS) for the customer to block his\ncard and get a confirmation to that effect after blocking the card.\n5.16 Security Issues and Risk mitigation measures related to Card Not Present\n(CNP) transactions\nBanks have been mandated to necessarily put in place additional factor of\nauthentication/validation based on information not visible on the cards for all on-line\nCard not Present (CNP) transactions in a phased manner, starting with online\ntransactions followed by Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Mail Order Telephone\nOrder(MOTO) and Standing Instructions (SI).

As such, foreclosure charges are seen as a\nrestrictive practice deterring the borrowers from switching over to cheaper available\nsource.\n6.3.2 The removal of foreclosure charges/prepayment penalty on home loans will lead\nto reduction in the discrimination between existing and new borrowers and competition\namong banks will result in finer pricing of the floating rate home loans.

Customer Confidentiality Obligations\nThe scope of the secrecy law in India has generally followed the common law principles\nbased on implied contract. The bankers' obligation to maintain secrecy arises out of the\ncontractual relationship between the banker and customer, and as such no information\nshould be divulged to third parties except under circumstances which are well defined.\nThe following exceptions to the said rule are normally accepted:\n(i) Where disclosure is under compulsion of law\n(ii) Where there is duty to the public to disclose\n(iii) Where interest of bank requires disclosure and\n(iv) Where the disclosure is made with the express or implied consent of the\ncustomer.\n25.1 Collecting Information from customers for cross-selling purposes\nAt the time of opening of accounts of the customers, banks collect certain information.\nWhile complying with the above requirements, banks also collect a lot of additional\npersonal information.\nIn this connection, the Committee on Procedures and Performances Audit on Public\nServices (CPPAPS) observed that the information collected from the customer was\nbeing used for cross selling of services of various products by banks, their subsidiaries\n- 8 8 -\nDBOD-Master Circular on Customer Service 2014"}

As\nbanks are aware, the information provided by the customer for KYC compliance while\nopening an account is confidential and divulging any details thereof for cross selling or\nany other purpose would be in breach of customer confidentiality obligations. Banks\nshould treat the information collected from the customer for the purpose of opening of\naccount as confidential and not divulge any details thereof for cross selling or any other\npurposes. Banks may, therefore, ensure that information sought from the customer is\nrelevant to the perceived risk, is not intrusive, and is in conformity with the guidelines\nissued in this regard.\nWherever banks desire to collect any information about the customer for a purpose\nother than KYC requirements, it should not form part of the account opening form. Such\ninformation may be collected separately, purely on a voluntary basis, after explaining\nthe objectives to the customer and taking his express approval for the specific uses to\nwhich such information could be put. Banks should therefore, instruct all the branches to\nstrictly ensure compliance with their obligations to the customer in this regard.\n26. Transfer of account from one branch to another\n26.1 Instructions of a customer for transfer of his account to another office should be\ncarried out immediately on receipt of, and in accordance with, his instructions. It should\nbe ensured that along with the balance of the account, the relative account opening\nform, specimen signatures, standing instructions, etc., or the master sheets wherever\nobtained, are also simultaneously transferred, under advice to the customer.\n26.2 The account transfer form with the enclosures may be handed over to the\ncustomer in a sealed cover if he so desires for delivery at the transferee office / branch.\nHowever, the transferee office should also be separately supplied with a copy of the\naccount transfer letter.\n26.3 When an office receives an enquiry from a customer regarding the receipt of his\naccount on transfer from another office it should take up the matter with the transferor\noffice by electronic means, in case it has not received the balance of the account and/or\nother related papers even after a reasonable transit time.\n- 8 9 -\nDBOD-Master Circular on Customer Service 2014"}

Switching banks by customers\nBanks should ensure that depositors dissatisfied with customer service have the facility\nto switch banks and thwarting depositors from such switches would invite serious\nadverse action.\n28. Co-ordination with officers of Central Board of Direct Taxes\nThere is a need for greater co-ordination between the income-tax department and the\nbanking system. As such banks should extend necessary help/co-ordination to tax\nofficials whenever required. Further, banks will have to view with serious concern cases\nwhere their staff connive/assist in any manner with offences punishable under the\nIncome Tax Act. In such cases in addition to the normal criminal action, such staff\nmember should also be proceeded against departmentally.\n29.

This implies that when\nCentral Government itself has notified a day as \"public holiday\" under Section 25 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881, there is no need for banks to wait for the State\nGovernment notification.\n30.
