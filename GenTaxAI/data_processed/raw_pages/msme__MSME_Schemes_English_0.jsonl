In this direction, “Make in India and Made in\nIndia” movement is integral to entrepreneurship development across the\ncountry. Therefore, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a\nvital role for strengthening the Indian economy.\nMSMEs have been contributing to spreading entrepreneurial culture through\nbusiness innovations. Unique feature of MSMEs is that they are widely\ndispersed across sectors of economy producing diverse range of products and\nservices to meet local as well as global markets. Needless to mention that the\ncontribution of MSME is 8 per cent of GDP, 45 per cent of manufacturing\noutput and 40 per cent of exports of the country and uniquely they are least\ninvestment driven with high returns. Employment creation is next to\nagriculture, thus MSME sector has potential of tapping individuals to\nassociate with economic activities by way of self-employemnt.\nOne of the priorities of our Government is the inclusive concept in enterprise\ncreation. In this endeavour, this compilation would benefit all those\nentrepreneurs including first generation, women, scheduled tribes, scheduled\ncastes, handicapped, ex-servicemen, marginalized communities, etc., for\nenabling them in creating enterprises.\nMinistry of MSME has a number of schemes and programmes to help and\nassist entrepreneurs’ especially small businesses. Though ours is a dedicated\nMinistry for MSME, number of other Ministries in the Government of India\nhas been supporting the cause. Leveraging information would enable\nprospective and existing entrepreneurs to spiral up their business prospects.\nIn order to appreciate, understand and utilize the compiled information, it is\nrecommended to every entrepreneur (budding, existing), institution\n(Government, private) engaged in training of trainers, entrepreneurship and\nskill development, etc., to take advantage of this for enterprise creation. This\nbecomes a ready reference and reckoner for everyone.\n(Kalraj Mishra)"}

This compilation enables the\nfirst generation entrepreneurs with lot of business ideas and thoughts who\ncould derive full benefit in terms of minimizing their struggle to look for right\nsource of information for their guidance. Existing entrepreneurs could plan for\nexpansion and diversification.\nTransition from micro to small and medium enterprise is a continuous process\nin entrepreneurial domain. This is possible by harnessing the resources and\nsupport that is prevalent and created by the Government of India through\nvarious ministries.\nI solicit one and all to take full advantage of this compilation and join hands to\nprosper.\n(Giriraj Singh)"}

It has been a good initiative by our\nMinistry to have collated this information into a single compilation. I\ncongratulate NIMSME (National Institute for Micro, Small and Medium\nEnterprises) for this endeavour.\nInformation is power. Unfortunately people for whom certain types of\ninformation are disseminated are seldom able to locate such information.\nMSMEs are especially handicapped because such enterprises are run\nessentially by the entrepreneur along with one or two close associates. Thus,\nunlike a large enterprise which may have designated set of personnel to scout\nfor available information continuously MSME entrepreneur do not have that\nluxury. On this count also this compilation would serve a very useful purpose.\nIn addition to entrepreneurs belonging to micro, small and medium sector,\npolicy makers, academics and public at large may also find this compilation\nuseful.\nI convey my best wishes.\n(Anup K.

To sum it up, this compilation is comprehensive information on\nenterprise development.\nI appreciate the efforts taken by ni-msme in bringing out the schemes of\nvarious ministries as compendium and strongly believe that everyone\nassociated with the process of entrepreneurship building would take full\nadvantage of the outcome of the compilation.
