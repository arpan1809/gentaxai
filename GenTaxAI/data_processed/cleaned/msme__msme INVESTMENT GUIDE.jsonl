During 1958 to 1974, 35 Industrial Estates spread over 4,230 acres were setup by the Director of Industries and Commerce. The first Industrial Estate was formed at Guindy in the year 1958 in an extent of 404.08 acres. Ambattur Industrial Estate, the largest MSME Industrial Estate spread over 1167 acres was established in 1963. Government transferred all the 35 Industrial Estates which were under the control of Director of Industries and Commerce to SIDCO. SIDCO has been managing these Industrial Estates on agency basis. 19.4.2 SIDCO Industrial Estates: Developing Industrial Estates is the most important function of SIDCO. The land is acquired mostly through Government alienation or directly purchased from the land owners and industrial plots are laid out thereon. [[[ 19.5 Women Industrial Estates To encourage Women entrepreneurs, it was decided to develop 5 new Industrial Estates exclusively for women. Accordingly, 5 new Women Industrial Estates were developed at Thirumullaivoyal, (Thiruvallur District) (in 225.80 acres / 785 plots were developed), Valavanthankottai, (Trichy District) (in 51.70 Acres - 110 plots were developed), Karuppur, (Salem District) (in 51.74 acres - 154 plots were developed), Kappalur, (Madurai District) (in 18.45 acres - 70 plots were developed), and Thirumudivakkam, (Kancheepuram District) (in 10.75 acres - 76 plots were developed). 19.6 Industrial sheds for Tiny Sector In the year 1980, SIDCO through SIDCO-TIIC consortium scheme and by its own has constructed around 1919 tiny sheds in 105 locations for the benefit of micro entrepreneurs.

Government of India and Government of Tamil Nadu are extending their support for creation and up-gradation of infrastructure facilities in new/existing Industrial Estates through various schemes like Micro, Small Enterprises-Cluster Development Programme (MSE-CDP) – Infrastructure Development Scheme, Industrial Infrastructure Upgradation Scheme (IIUS), Assistance to States for Infrastructure Development of Export and Allied Activities (ASIDE) and the Part II Scheme of Government of Tamil Nadu by sanctioning of grants. 21. Micro and Small Enterprises – Cluster Development Programme (MSE-CDP) Under this Scheme, the grant is availed from the Government of India for the following: • MSE - CDP (Infrastructure Development) • MSE - CDP (Common Facility Centre) 21.1 Infrastructure Development under the MSE - CDP Scheme Under this Scheme, the Government of India sanctions 60% of the project cost (maximum project cost of Rs. 10 Crores) subject to a ceiling of Rs.6 Crores as grant for the creation and up-gradation of infrastructure in new and existing Industrial Estates respectively. 21.2 Common Facility Centres (CFCs) under the MSE - CDP Scheme Micro and Small enterprises Cluster Development Programme (MSE (cid:1) CDP) aims at addressing the needs of the industries, through formation of well-defined clusters and geographical areas to enable the Micro and Small enterprises to have better access to resources, linkages to credit and to enhance their marketing competitiveness. A cluster is a group of similar and related enterprises in a defined geographic area that share common markets, technologies, worker skill needs and are producing same/similar products. Salient features of a cluster are as follows: a) The methods of production, quality control and testing, energy consumption, pollution control etc. are similar in nature. Page. 36"}
{"domain": "msme", "file": "msme INVESTMENT GUIDE.pdf", "page": 37, "text": "b) Technology and marketing strategies are similar. c) Easy communication among the members of the cluster d) Opportunities and Challenges are common. Government of India has adopted the cluster development approach as an important tool for enhancing the competitiveness and productivity of the Micro, Small and Medium enterprises. Clustering of units also enables providers of various services to them, including banks and credit agencies, to provide their services more economically, thus reducing costs and improving the availability of services for these enterprises. This scheme is being implemented to support the sustainability and growth of Micro and Small Enterprises by addressing common issues, to build capacity of them for common supportive action through formation of self-help groups, consortia etc. and to set up common facility centres (for testing, training centre, raw material depot, effluent treatment, complementing production processes, etc.) SIDCO has been nominated as the implementing Agency for Establishing Common Facility Centres in Tamil Nadu.
